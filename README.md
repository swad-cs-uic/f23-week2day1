# What is this repository

This is just the end result of what I did in class week 2 day 1. I do not recommend forking it / working from it, but instead setting up your own repo from scratch.

# What I did in the terminal

```bash
npm create vite@latest # answer relevant questions (all default I believe)
npm install
npm install --save-dev prettier
npm install --save-dev eslint
npm init @eslint/config # answer relevant questions (not all defaults)

npm run dev # to start the dev server

```

# Extra stuff

Things I recommend setting up in your final project repository but maybe didn't talk about in class:

- [husky and lint-staged](https://laurieontech.com/posts/husky/)
- [renovate bot](https://github.com/renovatebot/tutorial) - this will help keep your dependencies up to date
